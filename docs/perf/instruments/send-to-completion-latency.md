# Send-to-completion latency

```sh
LASH_LATENCY_ARTIFACT_DIR="$E/cross-worker" \
  just latency-gate --cases cross-worker --lanes 1 --scale-down
LASH_LATENCY_ARTIFACT_DIR="$E/poll" \
  just latency-gate --cases poll --lanes 1 --scale-down
LASH_LATENCY_ARTIFACT_DIR="$E/grace" \
  just latency-gate --cases grace --lanes 1 --scale-down
```

Each remote case launches a child durable node over one shared SQLite file.
The submitting core and marker observer serve no sessions. Child startup has
an explicit readiness handshake; closing its stdin requests node shutdown,
with a bounded kill-and-reap fallback. A child is killed if the case exits early.
The host submits only through `send()` and follows the persisted answer.

`cross-worker` uses production observer pacing. `poll` delays the terminal
wait's poll so the normal follow poll observes settlement. The historical
`grace` case extends the follow-poll ceiling to 120 seconds while preserving
the 25 ms floor used by binding discovery, alongside the remote terminal wait.
The current follower has no shift attach or live-report grace.
Both delayed paths still perform their first store read immediately. The
report's `follower` field names the current mode, and `poll_detect_ms` remains
a simulated 25 ms to 1 s schedule, not another measured clock.

Every latency case is a `service-diagnostic`: a lane sends its next sample
when the last one returns, and each span starts at the send. For
cross-worker send-to-completion under scheduled arrivals, run
`lash-perf offered-load --population cross-worker`.

These diagnostic runs retain completed samples but exit 2 because the fast
case did not run. This is functional proof, not a passing latency gate. The default
`just latency-gate` still runs every case and requires 10,000 fast samples,
overhead p50 below 50 ms and p99 below 250 ms on a qualified quiet host.
A successful child with `qualified=false` makes the load wrapper exit 3; a
failed child retains its own status. The load receipt records both
`exit_status` (child) and `certification_exit_status` (wrapper). Qualification
uses the maximum sampled 1-minute load average in the fast-case window against
the configured core-count bound; PSI is diagnostic. `just latency-gate`
propagates that status and cannot certify an unqualified run.
